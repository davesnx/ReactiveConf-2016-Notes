# React and Elm in production
by Richard Feldman

### 2013
We introduce a small piece of code into production in React.
Was so easy to maintain, fixing bugs, adding features.
It’s all about simplicity and maintainability

--

### 2014
We made all our main pattern on our Front-End App.
Elm code is much easier to maintain than the same code written in React (woot!)

--

### 2015
Migrated from react to elm

--

### 2016
hybrid react-elm app
have 50k lines of Elm code in production
1.5 years in prod with 0 runtime exceptions :)
react + elm can co-exist
good programmers wanna use awesome tech
hiring has become incredibly easier after migrating to elm
onboarding is not that hard as one might think
“if it compiles, it usually just works” :)

### The Elm learning courve compared to react
They figuret out that are equal.
The compiler on Elm is just awesome, it teachs you and recommends docs:
